 ## Description 
 * Project displays three seperate programs achieving different ways to extract, organize, and display data to user under different constrictions. Each project is written in either shell or python 3.
 ## Programs
 * DNA Translation
 * Genomic Variations: Search for Motifs in DNA
 * PDB Histogram

## DNA Translation
    
Purpose:

 * Demonstration of DNA translation by using shell/python

Usage:

 Running program in shell:
 
 `./prog_1_dna_translation.sh dna_file`

 Running program in python3:

 `./prog_1_dna_translation.sh dna_file`

Constraints:  

1. Directionality of DNA
2. Central Dogma of Biology
3. DNA Codons
4. Start and Stop codons
5. Pathname of 'DNA' file is only command line argument, text file or FASTA file.
6. File must contain DNA string with no new line characters or white space characters of any kind within it
